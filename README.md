Hey there! üëãüèº

I'm a junior front-end developer with a background in economics. I love bringing analytical thinking and efficiency to my projects, always finding clever solutions to problems.

I'm a calm, organized person who loves to listen and learn. I'm super curious and always on the lookout to pick up new skills. I also really enjoy working in teams and sharing ideas.

Lately, I've been diving into **Next.js**, **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**, and I've had a lot of fun bringing designs to life with seamless user interfaces. I'm still exploring the vast world of development, but my enthusiasm for learning keeps me motivated to take on new challenges with creativity and determination.

I'm pretty comfortable with **GitHub** and have explored **Angular** too, adding to my growing skillset.

Can't wait to see what comes next!
