Hi there üëãüèº,

I'm Melissa, a junior front-end developer with a background in economics. I bring analytical thinking, a focus on efficiency, and strategic thinking to my projects by being recursive in the solutions I come up with and implement.

I'm a calm, **organized** person who is willing to listen, with a great natural curiosity for learning and acquiring new knowledge and skills. Additionally, I have experience working in teams, so I understand and value collaboration and the exchange of ideas.

My recent projects have involved **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, where I've enjoyed bringing designs to life and crafting seamless user interfaces. While I'm still exploring the vast world of development, my enthusiasm for learning and personal growth propels me to embrace new challenges with determination and creativity.

I'm also no stranger to version control systems like **GitHub**, and I've dabbled in **Angular**, adding to my toolkit of skills.
