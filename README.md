### Hi there 👋🏼, I'm Melissa

# Junior Front-end Developer

I'm a self-taught developer with a background in economics who started coding two years ago. 

I found my passion for software development after my first `console.log()`😉 and since then, I have been immersed in learning and building web applications. 

Lately, I've been diving into **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

Can't wait to see what comes next!
